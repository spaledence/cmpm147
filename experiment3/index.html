				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Generate an overworld and dungeon landscape with some autotiling and editable with the textboxes underneath.<br>
					<u>Overworld Codes</u><br>
					"_" = grass<br>
					"w" = water<br>
					"." = edge<br>
					"h" = house<br>
					"^" = dirt<br>
					<u>Dungeon Codes</u><br>
					"_" = wall<br>
					"." = room floor<br>
					"c" = chest<br>
					"p" = path<br>
					"^" = dirt<br
					Tiles from from <a href="https://thkaspar.itch.io/micro-tileset-overworld-dungeon">Micro Tileset - Overworld & Dungeon by thkaspar</a>
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>First the textbox is created and filled in with the constraints that we set based on how we want our map to look. From there,
					we place tiles in said locations of the grid based on the value of the variable in each grid row, column pair. These tiles are customizable and ultimately make up the visual aspect of our world.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Honestly, this project was a lot more work than I initially expected. I went into this project starting a late due to another class project, 
					and I was not aware of how much work it actually was. It took me a while to figure out how exactly the tiles were working and it was especially hard for me to understand how to implement auto tiling given the instructions we had.
					 I actually read through the tutorial link and I feel like I have a decent understanding of how auto tiling works, but I was not able to make it work properly in my program. I did give it several attempts though and got a pseudo method of it working, 
					 but my tile offsets for corners and sides were not how I wanted them, and I feel like at this point I just need to turn something in that works, so I scrapped what I had.
