				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This is my first experiment using Glitch in which I've created a prompt generator that gives a variety of Breaking News Reports. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I edited the template and filler words, while also making sure to understand what is being written in the replacer and generator functions that make the process possible. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>The process of starting Glitch and writing the code was fairly easy and did not take a whole lot of time. Transferring the code from Glitch to my website took a bit longer, but still was relatively intuitive. 
					I worked on this experiment by myself.
