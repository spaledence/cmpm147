				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This was the second infinite world that I created. I decided to create a landscape that contains a lake and some different trees. The user is able to place trees on click while there is not already a tree in the tile and on land.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>In order to create this map, I spawn a lake in the center of the map. I then decide to stop placing lake tiles based on how far away from the center the tiles are. I also used perlin noise in an attempt to help me create different layers to the terrain. 
					While the terrain is not particularly clean, it does allow for the differentiaton between some sand tiles and normal grass tiles. I also used the hash function to place some extra green dots around the map to add a bit more grass.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was the second board I created. I would have liked to make the terrain look a bit better, but aside from that I think the design is a good introduction. </p>
