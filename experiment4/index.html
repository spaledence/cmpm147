				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This is my first infinite world that I created. This world is a beach design and allows the user to place an umbrella when clicking on the sand.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p> For this map, I split the map into two sides and have beach tiles on one side and ocean tiles on the other. The beach and ocean tiles utilize the hash function to create a bit of random texture. The beach umbrella is made using a few different ellipses and rects.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was the first map I created and I knew that I wanted to create a beach map. It was kind of hard to figure out how to draw the beach umbrella, but I'm glad I ultimately got it to look somewhat like it is supposed to.  </p>
